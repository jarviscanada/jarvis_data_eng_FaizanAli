# Faizan Ali . Jarvis Consulting

My passion for Computer Science started at a very early age where I would spend days trying to figure out how certain components/software on my computer work or as was often the case why they don't work. Though early on this was mainly focused on games that would refuse to work on my Computer or were just laggy(I had a very old computer with terrible specs).  My days fiddling around on my computer and admittedly, breaking 1 or 2 when I was a kid and decided to open it up myself to fix broken components such as USB ports(who knew you shouldn't open up computers on the carpet while wearing socks) pushed me to learn more about Computer Science and the software industry.

To pursue my passion and interest in Computer Science, I graduated with my Bachelors of Science(Honours) in Computer Science from the University of Ontario Institute of Technology(UOIT) in 2019, after which I got my Post Grad Certificate in AI Analysis, Design and Implementation at Durham College in 2021. My education helped develop my theoretical and practical skills in various aspects of computer science such as Software Development, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence.

After I got my bachelor's degree and was pursuing my Post Grad certificate I got the opportunity to work as a Research Associate/developer at the AI Hub.  In this role I got the chance to learn from and work alongside some of the top professionals in the industry using my skills in computer science/software development to research and develop easy to maintain, AI and Computer Vision-based software according to client requirements.

My education and experiences have led me to become someone very passionate about Computer Science and always on the lookout to enhance my skills by learning more about it.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_FaizanAli](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_FaizanAli)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_FaizanAli/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a monitoring agent program using Bash scripts for Linux OS. This program collects hardware specification and resource usage data for the system and then stores it into a relational database. The database to store the information was created using PostgreSQL and deployed locally using a Docker image for Linux. 

- Host Info script: Collect hardware specifications and inserts them into the appropriate table
- Usage Infor script: Collect server usage data and insert it into the appropriate table. This script is executed every minute using Linux crontab to allow us to get data at regular intervals on usage.


**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_FaizanAli/tree/master/core_java)]:

## Highlighted Projects
**Deep Learning - Picture Analysis** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Faizan1394/Image-identifier)]: 

- Created an android application to send picture data from an android device to a windows application over a wireless network.
- Programmed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect objects in pictures using Python and the Keras library with an accuracy of about 85 percent.
- Implemented Java based solution to allow two-way communication between the Android application and the windows application.


**Parallel Path finding algorithm** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Faizan1394/Parallel-Genetic-Algorithm)]: Find the best path between 2 cities using the genetic algorithm.

- Created very similar parallel versions of a genetic algorithm in Java and C++ using Java and POSIX threads to find the shortest path between a list of cities based on how far apart each city was from each other.
- Analyzed the two implementations to compare performance of the algorithm implemented in different languages.
