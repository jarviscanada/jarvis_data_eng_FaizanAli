summary: |
  My passion for Computer Science started at a very early age when I would spend days figuring out how specific components/software on my computer work.  My early interest in the inner working of computers soon developed into a passion that pushed me to learn more about Computer Science.

  To pursue my passion and interest in Computer Science, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science(Honours) in Computer Science from the University of Ontario Institute of Technology(UOIT) in 2019. I then got a Post Grad Certificate in AI Analysis, Design, and Implementation from Durham College in 2021.  My education helped develop my theoretical and practical skills in various aspects of computer science such as Software Development, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence.

  While pursuing my Post Grad certificate, I got the opportunity to work as a Research Associate/developer at the AI Hub.  At this job I got the chance to learn from and work alongside some of the top professionals in the industry using my skills in computer science/software development to research and develop easy to maintain, AI and Computer Vision-based software according to client requirements.
  
  My education and experiences have led me to become someone very passionate about Computer Science and always on the lookout to enhance my skills by learning more about it.

      Developed a monitoring agent program using Bash scripts for Linux OS. This program collects hardware specification and resource usage data for the system and then stores it into a relational database. The database to store the information was created using PostgreSQL and deployed locally using a Docker image for Linux. 
      
      - Host Info script: Collect hardware specifications and inserts them into the appropriate table
      - Usage Infor script: Collect server usage data and insert it into the appropriate table. This script is executed every minute using Linux crontab to allow us to get data at regular intervals on usage.

      - Created an android application to send picture data from an android device to a windows application over a wireless network.
      - Programmed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect objects in pictures using Python and the Keras library with an accuracy of about 85 percent.
      - Implemented Java based solution to allow two-way communication between the Android application and the windows application.

      Find the best path between 2 cities using the genetic algorithm.

      - Created very similar parallel versions of a genetic algorithm in Java and C++ using Java and POSIX threads to find the shortest path between a list of cities based on how far apart each city was from each other.
      - Analyzed the two implementations to compare performance of the algorithm implemented in different languages.
