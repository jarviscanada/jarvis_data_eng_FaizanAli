  "summary": "My passion for Computer Science started at a very early age when I would spend days figuring out how specific components/software on my computer work.  My early interest in the inner working of computers soon developed into a passion that pushed me to learn more about Computer Science.\n\nTo pursue my passion and interest in Computer Science, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science(Honours) in Computer Science from the University of Ontario Institute of Technology(UOIT) in 2019. I then got a Post Grad Certificate in AI Analysis, Design, and Implementation from Durham College in 2021.  My education helped develop my theoretical and practical skills in various aspects of computer science such as Software Development, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence.\n\nWhile pursuing my Post Grad certificate, I got the opportunity to work as a Research Associate/developer at the AI Hub.  At this job I got the chance to learn from and work alongside some of the top professionals in the industry using my skills in computer science/software development to research and develop easy to maintain, AI and Computer Vision-based software according to client requirements.\n\nMy education and experiences have led me to become someone very passionate about Computer Science and always on the lookout to enhance my skills by learning more about it.\n"
